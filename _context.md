## Session log

### 2026-03-26 — workflow cleanup
- Deleted `azure-static-web-apps-brave-glacier-00ea1c60f.yml` — was trying to deploy nyrr-viewer (Flask/App Service) to SWA with `output_location: "build"`, causing every push to main to fail
- Remaining SWA workflow (`orange-tree`) deploys mmr-webapp — output_location is `""`, correct for Next.js

### 2026-03-26 — repo cleanup
- Converted docs to markdown
- Fixed .gitignore (excludes secrets, binaries, .docx)
- Committed review-app
- Status: clean build, main branch
### 2026-03-26 23:15 ET — Azure nyrr-viewer DB connection fix
- Bug: MySQL "Access denied using password: NO" — DATABASE_URL was missing from Azure App Service env vars; gunicorn startup command had been accidentally pasted into that field instead
- Fix: Corrected DATABASE_URL value to `mysql://mmradmin:...@mmr-mysql-v4....:3306/mmrdb`; gunicorn command belongs in Configuration → General settings → Startup Command
- Note: load_env.sh referenced in CLAUDE.md doesn't exist at scripts/load_env.sh — actual file is load-env.sh at repo root; webapp uses web-apps/mmr-webapp/start-dev.sh
- Status: resolved, connection working

### 2026-03-26 23:28 ET — nyrr-viewer: permissions, auto-match, club code fixes
- Bug 1: `require_role` read stale session role set at login; admin@mmrunners.org got 403 "Insufficient permissions" if session predated their DB entry. Fix: re-query `get_user_role(email)` on every role-protected request and refresh session.
- Bug 2: No way to re-run auto-match on an already-loaded event. Added `POST /api/events/<id>/automatch` endpoint + "Auto-match" button in runner table toolbar.
- Bug 3: `unmatched_only` filter hardcoded `AND er.team_code = 'MMR'`, hiding all non-MMR unmatched runners even after "All runners" load. Removed constraint; renamed checkbox label "Unmatched MMR" → "Unmatched". Team scoping now handled by the existing team dropdown.
- Files changed: tools/nyrr-viewer/app.py, tools/nyrr-viewer/templates/index.html
